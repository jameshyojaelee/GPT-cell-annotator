# Data workspace

This directory is intentionally kept empty in version control. Packaged demo and offline
assets live under `src/gpt_cell_annotator/_assets` and are materialised to
`~/.cache/gpt-cell-annotator` when running the CLI. Use `data/` as scratch space for
locally built artifacts such as marker database outputs or regenerated demo datasets.
